# Plasma-wallet-web3 ðŸš€
Welcome  ðŸ‘‹ to the Plasma Wallet project  :). This is a project focused on creating a self custody wallet. With this wallet you can check prices and balance 
in your different address. This is still a work in a progress but a step forward into Web3. I attempted to use Moralis SDK as much as I could to simplify 
the development.
